This application 'BigBoxApp03b' is one of several capstone projects created in the CincyCodeIT - Java boot camp - Spring 2017.

The application creates and relies on a database (BiggerBox) with 3 tables: divisions, stores, and store_sales.

The application simulates querying of this database for several business purposes: listing stores, summarizing sales, adding and removing stores.
